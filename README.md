# MCP PDF Reader

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Work in Progress**: This project is under active development. Features and APIs may change.

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server in Go for reading and extracting text from PDF files. This server enables AI assistants like Claude to read and analyze PDF documents with high-quality text extraction powered by Google's PDFium library.

## Features

- ‚úÖ **High-quality text extraction** from PDF files using PDFium (Google Chrome's PDF engine)
- ‚úÖ Read full text content from PDF files
- ‚úÖ Search for text in PDF files with context and page numbers
- ‚úÖ Case-sensitive and case-insensitive search options
- ‚úÖ Configurable context length around matches
- ‚úÖ No CGO dependencies (uses WebAssembly)
- üîÑ Read text content from specific pages or page ranges *(planned)*
- üîÑ Read PDF metadata (author, title, creation date, etc.) *(planned)*
- üîÑ Get the total page count of a PDF *(planned)*
- üîÑ Process multiple PDF sources (local paths or URLs) in a single request *(planned)*

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.25 or higher
- Git

### Build from source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/lwsbrdx/mcp-pdf.git
cd mcp-pdf

# Build the server
make build
# or
go build -o pdf-server main.go
```

### Using Docker

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t mcp-pdf-reader:latest .

# Run with Docker (interactive mode for testing)
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize",...}' | docker run --rm -i mcp-pdf-reader:latest
```

The Docker image is optimized using multi-stage builds and weighs only ~35MB (includes embedded PDFium WebAssembly binary).

## Usage

### With Claude Code

Add the server to your Claude Code configuration file (`~/.config/claude-code/mcp_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pdf-reader": {
      "command": "/path/to/mcp-pdf/pdf-server"
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Code, and the PDF reading tool will be available.

### Testing the server

You can test the server using the official MCP client:

```bash
# Install the Go SDK examples
git clone https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk.git

# Use the listfeatures client
cd go-sdk/examples/client/listfeatures
go run main.go /path/to/pdf-server
```

## Available Tools

### `read_pdf`

Reads the full text content from a PDF file.

**Parameters:**
- `path` (string): Path to the PDF file

**Returns:**
- `content` (string): Extracted text content from the PDF

**Example usage:**
```json
{
  "name": "read_pdf",
  "arguments": {
    "path": "/path/to/document.pdf"
  }
}
```

### `search_in_pdf`

Searches for specific text in a PDF file and returns all matches with page numbers and surrounding context.

**Parameters:**
- `path` (string, required): Path to the PDF file
- `query` (string, required): Text to search for
- `page` (number, optional): Specific page number to search in (searches all pages if not provided)
- `case_sensitive` (boolean, optional): Whether to perform case-sensitive search (default: false)
- `context_length` (number, optional): Number of characters of context around each match (default: 50)

**Returns:**
- `matches` (array): List of matches found
  - `page` (number): Page number where the match was found
  - `context` (string): Text surrounding the match
  - `match_start` (number): Start position of the match in the context
  - `match_end` (number): End position of the match in the context
- `total_count` (number): Total number of matches found

**Example usage:**
```json
{
  "name": "search_in_pdf",
  "arguments": {
    "path": "/path/to/document.pdf",
    "query": "machine learning",
    "case_sensitive": false,
    "context_length": 80
  }
}
```

**Example response:**
```json
{
  "matches": [
    {
      "page": 5,
      "context": "...the implementation of machine learning algorithms has revolutionized...",
      "match_start": 25,
      "match_end": 42
    }
  ],
  "total_count": 1
}
```

## Development

### Running tests

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with verbose output
go test -v ./...

# Run tests for a specific package
go test ./internal -v
```

docker build -t mcp-pdf-reader:latest .
```

### Configuration with Claude Code

To use the Docker image with Claude Code, update your MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pdf-reader": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "--rm", "-i", "mcp-pdf-reader:latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Image details

- **Base image**: Alpine Linux (minimal, secure)
- **Size**: ~35MB (multi-stage build with embedded PDFium WebAssembly)
- **User**: Runs as non-root user `mcp` (UID 1000)
- **Transport**: stdio (standard input/output)
- **No CGO**: Uses WebAssembly for cross-platform compatibility

## Benchmarks *(Planned)*

Performance benchmarks will be added once the core features are stable.
